Before setting up multipole
Single-electron SR calculation ... Warning: Computation of terminating terms of radiation integrals WAS NOT PERFORMED for some values of input parameters  because asymptotic expansion validity criterion was not satisfied. This may influence the accuracy of the computation.  One can try to fix the problem by modifying Magnetic Field definition range and/or Integration limits.
