Description:
    The DEPO variable stores the laser energy deposition in each cell if
    ed_depoVarName is set to "depo" (which should be the default below). If the
    variable is declared with TYPE: PER_VOLUME, the deposited energy is stored
    as an energy density; otherwise the deposited energy stored is stored as a
    specific energy (per mass unit).
