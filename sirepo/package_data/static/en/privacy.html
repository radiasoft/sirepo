              <p>Welcome to RadiaSoft. This Privacy Policy (the “<strong>Policy”</strong>) applies to the information collected through website and software available at <a href="/">https://sirepo.com</a> and any other website on which we post this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “<strong>Site</strong>”). This Policy forms an agreement between you and RadiaSoft LLC (“<strong>RadiaSoft</strong>,” “<strong>us</strong>,” “<strong>our</strong>,” or “<strong>we</strong>”).</p>

              <p>This Policy describes what information we collect when you visit our Site, how we (or our service providers) may use, process, and share that information, your choices with regard to your information, and other related matters. This Policy is incorporated into our Terms of Use. Through your continued use of our Site, you acknowledge and agree to the practices described in this Policy. Terms not otherwise defined here will have the same definitions as set forth in our Terms of Use.</p>

              <p>Except as otherwise expressly set forth below, this Policy is applicable only to information we collect through our Site. This Policy does not apply to any information that you provide offline, whether in person, over the phone, or otherwise. Similarly, this Policy does not apply to information collected by third parties, regardless of whether you arrive at such third parties’ website through our Site.</p>

We may also send you information or notices if relevant to your request.</p>

              <p><strong>When you use the Site.</strong> We will collect information about your device and your use of our Site, such as your IP address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the internet, which may vary from session to session), browser type, domain names, access times, and referring web Site addresses. We will log click-stream data, which typically includes information such as the page served, the time, the source and type of browser making the request, the most recent page view, and other non-personal data. We collect these types of data for purposes of system administration, to improve our Site, and for other internal uses related to the Site. This information also helps us analyze how visitors arrive at our Site, and what type of content and features are most popular.</p>

              <h4>Use of Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies</h4>

              <p>Our Site uses cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, and Google Analytics. Cookies are small data files that are transferred to your hard drive when you visit a website if your browser settings permit the acceptance of cookies. Similar technologies, such as web beacons or pixel tags, function through the use of small files, such as a GIF or PNG, which are opened on a page, ad, or in an email. The request for these files from a server reveals certain information about your device, such as your browser type, device information (such as OS version, device model), IP address, etc. These technologies can also be used to determine how you interact with our Site, emails, or ads, such as to tell us whether an email or ad was viewed, opened, or clicked, and other similar information. To learn more about cookies and similar tracking technologies, and how they can affect your privacy, visit <a href="https://allaboutcookies.org">allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>

              <p>We use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, and Google Analytics on our Site for the following purposes:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>For “essential” or “functional” purposes, such as to enable various features of the Site such as remembering passwords, or staying logged in during your session;</li>
                  <li>For “analytics” purposes, to learn how our Site is used or performs, how users engage with and navigate our Site, how often they visit our Site, and other similar information.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Please note, most modern browsers include a “do not track” feature that may limit the information collected by these technologies. However, our Site does not currently respond to your browser’s do-not-track request.</p>

              <p><strong>Cookies and Similar Technologies.</strong> If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, you can turn off cookies using your browser’s settings menu; however, this may eliminate our ability to provide you with a personalized or user-friendly experience on our Site. To learn more about, or to opt-out of Google’s analytic and marketing services, visit <a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/terms/us/" target=>Google Analytics Terms of Service</a>, <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US">Google Privacy Policy</a>, or <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">Google Analytics Opt-out</a>.</p>

              <p><span class="text-italic">Please note</span>: the use of cookies, web beacons or similar technologies by third party vendors may be subject to their own privacy policies and we disclaim all liability in connection with processing by these vendors that is not performed on our behalf.</p>

              <h4>How We Store Your Data and Storage Period</h4>
              <p>We collect and securely store information to provide better services to all our users.  We work hard to protect you and your data from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we store, to include:</p>

              </ul>

              <p>We will keep your data for different periods of time, depending on what it is and how we use it:</p>
              <ul>
