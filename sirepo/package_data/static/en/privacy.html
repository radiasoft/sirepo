              <h5>Effective May 1, 2019</h5>
              <hr class="gradient-rule" />

              <p>Welcome to RadiaSoft! This Privacy Policy (the “<strong>Policy”</strong>) applies to the information collected through website and software available at <a href="/">https://sirepo.com</a> and any other website on which we post this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “<strong>Service</strong>”). This Policy forms an agreement between you and RadiaSoft LLC (“<strong>RadiaSoft</strong>,” “<strong>us</strong>,” “<strong>our</strong>,” or “<strong>we</strong>”).</p>

              <p>This Policy describes what information we collect when you visit our Service, how we (or our service providers) may use, process, and share that information, your choices with regard to your information, and other related matters. This Policy is incorporated into our Terms of Service. Through your continued use of our Service, you acknowledge and agree to the practices described in this Policy. Terms not otherwise defined here will have the same definitions as set forth in our Terms of Service.</p>

              <p>Except as otherwise expressly set forth below, this Policy is applicable only to information we collect through our Service. This Policy does not apply to any information that you provide offline, whether in person, over the phone, or otherwise. Similarly, this Policy does not apply to information collected by third parties, regardless of whether you arrive at such third parties’ website through our Service.</p>

              <h4>Information We Collect and How We Use It</h4>

              <p>We may collect personal and other information about you when you use our Service. “<strong>Personal Data</strong>” includes any
                information about an identified or identifiable person. We generally collect and use personal data, as follows:</p>

              <p><strong>When you register to use the Service.</strong> During the account registration process, we collect Personal Data about Users such as the User’s name, email, username, password and other personal information that may be required to create an account. User login information may be collected or processed using a third-party ‘single sign-on’ application, like GitHub, and in such cases RadiaSoft will receive certain information provided by that third-party, such as the User’s name and email address (see the privacy policies of the third party for more information).</p>

              <p>We use the personal data we collect about Users during the registration process so that we can administer, manage and correspond with Users about the User’s account, and to improve our Service. We may add certain Users’ email addresses to our company mailing list, which informs our Users of notices, outages or other material that may be of interest to them.</p>

              <p>Note, we may allow Users to share certain information with other Users of the Service. Any information, such as a User profile, or your User Content, may be shared with other Users at your request. We do not control, and will not be liable, for these third parties’ use of your Personal Data or other information.</p>

              <p><strong>When you make a purchase.</strong> Our Service allows Users to purchase additional cloud computing power, additional storage space, or other account upgrades. If you would like to purchase the upgraded version of our Service, we will collect Personal Data required during the account registration process, as well as some billing information such as your credit card, billing address, and other authentication information. We, or our third party payment processor, will process this information in order to complete your payment. We will not store your financial information within our Service.</p>

              <p><strong>User-generated content.</strong> Sirepo provides a data modeling engine that is used by physicists to simulate the performance of particle accelerators, among other things. The Service allows Users to input data in the simulator, as well as store and share the models and outputs with other Users. All data, including the algorithms, outputs of simulations, and other personal data or content provided by the User (collectively, “User Content”) will remain the property of the User, subject to the licenses granted in our Terms of Use. If you choose to message another user, or otherwise share any User Content with a third party through the Service, you agree to disclose any personal
              data contained in the User Content to such third party and acknowledge that we are not responsible for the use of that information by the third party.</p>

              <p><strong>When you contact us through the Service.</strong> We will collect the personal data you voluntarily provide on the applicable form (typically your name and email address). Any information you provide through our Service will be used in the context of resolving your request or answering your inquiry, or to provide additional information related to that inquiry. We may also send you information or notices if relevant to your request.</p>

              <p><strong>When you use the Service.</strong> If you access our Service, we may collect information about your device and your use of our Service, such as your IP address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the internet, which may vary from session to session), browser type, domain names, access times, and referring web Service addresses. We may also log click-stream data, which typically includes information such as the page served, the time, the source and type of browser making the request, the most recent page view, and other non-personal data. We collect these types of data for purposes of system administration, to improve our Service, and for other internal uses related to the Service. This information also helps us analyze how visitors arrive at our Service, what type of content is most popular, what type of visitors in the aggregate are interested in particular features, and the like.</p>

              <h4>Use of Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies</h4>

              <p>Our Service may use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, and similar digital tracking technologies, such as Google Analytics. Cookies are small data files that are transferred to your hard drive when you visit a website if your browser settings permit the acceptance of cookies. Similar technologies, such as web beacons or pixel tags, function through the use of small files, such as a GIF or PNG, which are opened on a page, ad, or in an email. The request for these files from a server reveals certain information about your device, such as your browser type, device information (such as OS version, device model), IP address, etc. These technologies can also be used to determine how you interact with our Service, emails, or ads, such as to tell us whether an email or ad was viewed, opened, or clicked, and other similar information. To learn more about cookies and similar tracking technologies, and how they can affect your privacy, visit allaboutcookies.org.</p>

              <p>We typically use cookies and similar technologies on our Service for the following purposes:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>For “essential” or “functional” purposes, such as to enable various features of the Service such as remembering passwords, or staying logged in during your session;</li>
                <li>For “analytics” purposes, to learn how our Service is used or performs, how users engage with and navigate our Service, how often they visit our Service, and other similar information.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Please note, most modern browsers include a “do not track” feature that may limit the information collected by these technologies. However, our Service does not currently respond to your browser’s do-not-track request.</p>

              <h4>With Whom We Share Your Personal Data</h4>
              <p>We share with our service providers and affiliated entities certain personal data that we collect when you use our Service, register an account or purchase upgrades. We may also share your personal data with our current or future affiliated entities, subsidiaries, and parent companies.</p>

              <p>We may, without your consent, share personal data and other data with Service providers who provide certain services on our behalf, or in the other circumstances noted below. For example, we may share personal data we collect with third parties such as providers of data hosting or processing services, email and postal mail providers, payment processors, or other parties which provide the Service on our behalf.</p>

              <p>In extraordinary circumstances, we may, without your consent, share personal data when necessary or appropriate to comply with the law; cooperate with law enforcement or national security requirements; respond to lawful requests; protect our interests, customers, property, or the public; or, to enforce our Terms of Service. Similarly, we reserve the right to share personal data with governmental authorities or otherwise in response to a legal request that we believe requires us to do so. We will share any such information to the extent we believe that request requires. Legal requests include, for example, search warrants, subpoenas, and other court orders.</p>

              <p>Finally, in the event we undergo a merger, sale, transfer or liquidation of our business or substantially all of our assets, any personal data we possess may be part of the assets sold or otherwise transferred, or may be reviewed during due diligence review in the course of a potential transaction.</p>

              <h4>Your Choices</h4>

              <p><strong>Cookies and Similar Technologies.</strong> If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, you can turn off cookies using your browser’s settings menu; however, this may eliminate our ability to provide you with a personalized or user-friendly experience on our Service. To learn more about, or to opt-out of Google’s analytic and marketing services, visit <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Analytics Terms of Use</a>, the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Privacy Policy</a>, or <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Analytics Opt-out.</a></p>

              <p><em>Please note</em>: the use of cookies, web beacons or similar technologies by third party vendors may be subject to their own privacy policies and we disclaim all liability in connection with processing by these vendors that is not performed on our behalf.</p>

              <p><strong>User-generated content.</strong> Users may be able to share their data uploads, models, research, and User Content with other Users of the platform at their discretion. Sharing User Content can be controlled through the User’s account settings.</p>

              <p><strong>Account information.</strong> If you wish to delete personal data associated with your user account, you may do so at any time by emailing <a href="mailto:support@radiasoft.net">mailto:support@radiasoft.net</a> to your account.</p>

              <p>If you are a registered User, you may access and modify your Personal Data and other account information using your account settings page. You may close your User account at any time.</p>

              <p>We will respond to reasonable requests for access or revision to the extent required or allowed by law. However, we may refuse these requests where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy in any given case,or when the rights of others would be violated by granting the access.</p>

              <h4>Information Security</h4>

              <p>We use reasonable security measures to protect your personal data. We implement and review various physical, procedural and technological safeguards that we believe will keep your personal data secure.
